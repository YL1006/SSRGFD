# SSRGFD
Stereo Super-Resolution General Forensic Dataset
To meet the needs of the research about image tampering detection and localization on stereo super-resolution image, a high-quality stereo super-resolution image general forensic dataset (SSRGFD) is constructed. Forgery images in SSRGFD dataset are all stereo super-resolution images generated with Adobe Photoshop and deep learning algorithm. It contains three common categories of forgeries, copy-move, splicing and inpainting. Moreover, inpainting includes removal and restoration. For each forgery category, various preprocessing and post-processing methods are applied to cover visible traces of tamper. What’s more, the masks of the tampered region corresponding to each tampering image are provided.
